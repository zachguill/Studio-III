For this project we were required to use Adobe After Effects to annimate a holiday scene and add music to it. Digital media is not 
my strong suit, but I was able to learn how to make a basic video. I had to use Adobe photo shop to cut out an image, then animate 
it. To find the music, I had to pull the audio file and cut it to size. For this i actual only used the imbeded video editor on my PC.
