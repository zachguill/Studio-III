For this project we had to create a composite image using 2 or more photos in ADOBE Photoshop. For this project I cut the ghost image 
and added it to the forest background. I also changed the color of the background and made the ghost semi transparent. Before this 
project, I had never used photo editing software. It was interesting to learn, but it was not really my interest.
