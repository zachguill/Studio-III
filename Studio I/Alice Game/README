In this project we were required to use ALICE III software to create a simple game. My game was inspired by the bridge scene from
Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail. In order to complete this project we needed to both create the scene and come up with 
the logic of the game. While setting the scene was not my favorite, i enjoyed coming up with the logic required to create the game. 
SInce this class, I have gone on to create a few text based games.
