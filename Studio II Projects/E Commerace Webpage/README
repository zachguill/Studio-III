In this project we needed to create a simple E Commerace webpage. I chose to create a website that sold hiking boots. This involded 
creating html pages, javascript pages, and a css page. This project probably had the most pure coding out of any we did in all of the 
studio classes and i enjoyed it becasue of that. To create this website, I used replit. Since i have become more comfortable with VS 
Code, I would most likely use that now instead of replit.
