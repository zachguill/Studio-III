In this project we had the freedom to pick any computer related project as long as it took a significant amount of work. I chose to 
take an old computer i had laying around and switch the operating system to Linux. I chose Linux mint, replaced the original Windows OS
with it, then learned basic terminal commands for creating, moving, and deleting files.
